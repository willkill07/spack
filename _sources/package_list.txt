  Communication Interface. * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic
  Versions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard
  or Generalized Problems. * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or
  Generalized Problems. * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition. *
  Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
  numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
  precision. This project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and
  Scilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.
  Indeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the
  last few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...)
  forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to
  tackle this by providing a common repository and maintained versions.
  arpack-ng is replacing arpack almost everywhere.

  representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal
  was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no
  external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used
  standalone.

  context as well as the SST context. The qthreads API provides access to
  full/empty-bit (FEB) semantics, where every word of memory can be marked

Versions:
  0.6.9
Dependencies
  `R`_

Description:
  Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash digests
  of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, crc32, xxhash and
  murmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects,
  as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message
  authentication code. The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC
  1321, the sha-1 and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and
  FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm is described in
  ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,
  sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone
  implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code
  from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron
  D. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is
  used. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please
  note that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic
  purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such
  as OpenSSL should be used.

Description:
  Implements a simple key-value style database where character string keys
  are associated with data values that are stored on the disk. A simple
  interface is provided for inserting, retrieving, and deleting data from
  the database. Utilities are provided that allow 'filehash' databases to
  be treated much like environments and lists are already used in R. These
  utilities are provided to encourage interactive and exploratory analysis
  on large datasets. Three different file formats for representing the
  database are currently available and new formats can easily be
  incorporated by third parties for use in the 'filehash' framework.

Dependencies
  `R`_

Description:
  A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the
  web. Started out as a fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely
  rewritten in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high
  performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly
  powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a web API. The
  implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette (Ooms,
  2014). In addition to converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite'
  contains functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit
  tests included with the package verify that all edge cases are encoded
  and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and
  applications.

  syntaxes and outputs binary, ELF32 and ELF64 object formats.

Versions:
  0.5.0
Description:
  zfp is an open source C library for compressed floating-point arrays
  that supports very high throughput read and write random acces, target
  error bounds or bit rates. Although bit-for-bit lossless compression is
  not always possible, zfp is usually accurate to within machine epsilon
  in near-lossless mode, and is often orders of magnitude more accurate
  than other lossy compressors.

Description:
  zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered --
  that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library
  for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system.

Dependencies
  mpi

Description:
  The Zoltan library is a toolkit of parallel combinatorial algorithms for
  parallel, unstructured, and/or adaptive scientific applications.
  Zoltan's largest component is a suite of dynamic load-balancing and
  paritioning algorithms that increase applications' parallel performance
  by reducing idle time. Zoltan also has graph coloring and graph ordering
  algorithms, which are useful in task schedulers and parallel
  preconditioners.

Description:
   Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a
  powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh,
  and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.
